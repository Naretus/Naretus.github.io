    <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

    This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</br>

    Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)<br/>
    <li>175g of tahini<br/>
    <li>6 sundried tomatoes<br/>
    <li>Half a red pepper<br/>
    <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper<br/>
    <li>1 clove of garlic<br/>
    <li>A dash of olive oil
</ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p><b>Remove</b> the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</p>
    <p><b>Remove</b> all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</p>
    <p>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</p>
    <p>Process all the ingredients into a paste</p>
    <p><b><i>If</i></b> you want a coarse "<i>chunky</i>" hummus, process it for a <b>short</b> time</p>
    <p><b><i>If</i></b> you want a "<i>smooth</i>" hummus, process it for a <b>longer</b> time</p>

    For a <i>different flavour</i>, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese.<br/>
    <b><i>Experiment</i></b> and see what works for you.<br/>

    <h2>Storage</h2>

    Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container.<br/> You should be able to use it for <b>about a week</b> after you've made it.<br/> If it starts to become <i>fizzy</i>, you <b>should definitely</b> discard it.</br>

    Hummus is suitable for freezing; you <b>should</b> thaw it and use it within a <b>couple of months</b>.
